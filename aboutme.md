Welcome to the Multimodal Interaction Lab, run by Professor Catherine Guastavino and her many passionate students and postdocs at McGill University.
We are affiliated with the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology](https://www.cirmmt.org/)  and McGill University's [School of Information Studies](https://www.mcgill.ca/sis/).
The lab was established in 2006 with funding from the [Canadian Foundation for Innovation](https://www.innovation.ca/). We investigate how people make sense of the world around us through different sensory modalities, with an emphasis on hearing. We conduct fundamental and applied research, both in natural settings and in virtual environments, to understand how to best convey information for multimodal interaction. 
Our team is very interdisciplinary and we collaborate with academics from a wide range of disciplines as well as industry partners, cultural institutions, and municipal and provincial governments.
